The web app displays news related to Mars alongside a photograph the shows a sliced section of Mars's surface. This information is updated by clicking the "Scrape New Data" button porgrammed into the app. Additionally, a table was scraped and diplayed comparing facts between Earth and Mars.\
In my index.html file, I customized the page in a couple different ways. First, I added the viewport meta tag to my <head> to ensure proper rendering and touch zooming. Next, I made the background color of the jumbotron lightgoldenrodyellow. Lastly, I changed the header font colors to navy to contrast the gray and yellow backgrounds better.
